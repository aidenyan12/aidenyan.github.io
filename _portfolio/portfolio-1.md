The Yanamin Anatomy System is a comprehensive platform designed to revolutionize anatomical education through interactive 3D visualization. This flagship project represents the culmination of extensive research in medical visualization, user interface design, and educational technology.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
- Create an intuitive platform for exploring human anatomy in 3D
- Enhance learning outcomes for medical students and professionals
- Provide accessible anatomical education tools
- Support diverse learning styles and paces

### Key Features
- **High-Fidelity 3D Models**: Anatomically accurate representations of human body systems
- **Interactive Exploration**: Real-time manipulation and examination of structures
- **Multi-Layer Visualization**: Ability to show/hide different anatomical systems
- **Educational Integration**: Structured learning modules aligned with curricula
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React-based web application with Three.js for 3D rendering
- **Backend**: Node.js API with MongoDB for content management
- **3D Pipeline**: Custom tools for processing medical imaging data
- **Deployment**: Cloud-based infrastructure with global CDN

### Technologies Used
- React, Three.js, WebGL
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- Docker, Kubernetes
- AWS, CloudFormation
- Medical imaging formats (DICOM, NIfTI)

## Impact and Results

### Educational Outcomes
- 35% improvement in anatomical comprehension tests
