This presentation discussed the practical challenges and opportunities in translating machine learning research into clinical medical imaging applications.

## Abstract

Machine learning has shown tremendous promise in medical imaging research, but the path from laboratory to clinic remains challenging. This talk examined:

- Regulatory considerations for ML-based medical devices
- Data quality and standardization requirements
- Clinical validation methodologies
- Implementation strategies for healthcare systems

## Main Topics Covered

### Technical Challenges
- Model interpretability and explainability
- Robustness across different imaging protocols
- Handling of edge cases and rare conditions
- Integration with existing clinical workflows

### Regulatory Landscape
- FDA approval processes for ML-based devices
- European CE marking requirements
- Post-market surveillance obligations
- Quality management system considerations

### Implementation Strategies
- Pilot deployment frameworks
- Training requirements for clinical staff
- Performance monitoring and maintenance
- Cost-benefit analysis methodologies

## Case Studies

The presentation featured three detailed case studies:

1. **Automated Chest X-ray Analysis**: Deployment in emergency departments
2. **Retinal Disease Screening**: Population-scale implementation
3. **Anatomical Structure Segmentation**: Integration with surgical planning systems

## Outcomes and Impact

This work contributed to establishing best practices for clinical ML deployment and influenced regulatory guidelines in multiple jurisdictions.
