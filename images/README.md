# Image Placeholders

This directory contains images used throughout the site. In a real deployment, you would replace these placeholder descriptions with actual image files.

## Required Images

- `profile.png` - Profile photo for the author bio
- `yanamin-system.png` - Screenshot or diagram of the Yanamin Anatomy System
- `ml-toolkit.png` - Visual representation of the ML toolkit
- `favicon.ico` - Site favicon
- `site-logo.png` - Site logo for the header

## Image Guidelines

- Profile photos should be approximately 400x400 pixels
- Portfolio images should be 800x600 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- Use high-quality images with appropriate compression
- Ensure all images have descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Consider dark/light mode compatibility for logos and diagrams

## Placeholder Images

For development purposes, you can use placeholder services like:
