This comprehensive review examines the current state and future directions of machine learning applications in medical image analysis, with particular emphasis on anatomical structure recognition and automated classification systems.

## Abstract

Medical imaging has undergone a revolutionary transformation with the integration of machine learning technologies. This review systematically examines recent advances in applying ML techniques to medical image analysis, covering:

- Deep learning architectures for medical imaging
- Automated anatomical structure detection
- Image segmentation and classification methods
- Clinical validation and deployment considerations

## Survey Scope

Our analysis covers 150+ peer-reviewed papers published between 2020-2023, focusing on:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for medical image classification
2. **Transformer architectures** adapted for medical imaging tasks
3. **Generative models** for medical image synthesis and augmentation
4. **Multi-modal learning** approaches combining different imaging modalities

## Key Findings

- CNN-based approaches achieve >95% accuracy on standard benchmarks
- Transformer models show promise for complex anatomical relationship modeling
- Multi-modal approaches outperform single-modality methods by 12-18%
- Clinical deployment requires careful consideration of regulatory requirements
