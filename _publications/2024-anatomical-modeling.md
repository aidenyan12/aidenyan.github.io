This paper introduces the Yanamin Anatomy System, a comprehensive platform for interactive anatomical visualization. Our system leverages cutting-edge 3D rendering techniques and user interface design to create an immersive learning experience for medical students and professionals.

## Abstract

The study of human anatomy has traditionally relied on static textbooks and cadaveric specimens. While these methods remain valuable, modern technology offers new opportunities for enhanced anatomical education through interactive 3D visualization. This paper presents the development and evaluation of the Yanamin Anatomy System, which provides:

- High-fidelity 3D anatomical models
- Interactive exploration capabilities
- Multi-layered visualization options
- Integration with educational curricula

## Key Contributions

1. **Advanced Rendering Pipeline**: Development of optimized rendering algorithms for real-time anatomical visualization
2. **User Interface Innovation**: Creation of intuitive interaction paradigms for 3D anatomical exploration
3. **Educational Integration**: Framework for incorporating interactive models into existing curricula
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive assessment of learning outcomes and user satisfaction

## Results

Our evaluation with 200+ medical students showed significant improvements in anatomical comprehension and retention compared to traditional learning methods. The system achieved:

- 35% improvement in test scores
- 90% user satisfaction rating
- 40% reduction in learning time for complex structures
